## Taco-Cloud
This simple project samples the implementation of Spring JDBC in Spring web MVC.
<br/>
It allows the user to chose, among a list of ingredients, which ones he would like <br/>
his favorite taco to be made of and delivered to him to the address he/she requires to provide.
To keep things simple, I used an embedded database (H2).
